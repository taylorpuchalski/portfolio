      <!-- Picture 1  -->
      This is the unedited shallow DOF picture that I took! I'd definitely say
      it's my favorite picture taken in this class so far. It was difficult to
      figure out how to achieve the required effects using the camera, but I
      think this photo is a pretty good example of what we were supposed to do.
      Also, I couldn't figure out how to resize resize this week's images within
      Glitch, but I'm eager to learn it in class.

      <!-- N/A  -->
      Here are the edited and unedited versions, respectively, of the shallow DOF picture
      I adjusted manually. I had to look at a good amount of external tutorials
      to try and figure out how to achieve my exact goals on my iPad, but I'm
      proud of how it turned out. I realized after last week's homework
      assignment that one of the main reasons my Photoshop layout looked different was
      because I was using Photoshop Express instead of regular app, so
      this week I also had to relearn the basic features from last week.
