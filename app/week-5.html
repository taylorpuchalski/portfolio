      <!-- Picture 1  -->
      Here's my eye drawing! I chose the emotion Annoyance and tried my best to
      make it look like an eye roll. I'm not an artist by ANY means so I wasn't
      expecting to draw a great eye, and my results were pretty much within my
      expectations. For some reason, the lines I used for the eyelashes showed
      up as filled-in shapes when I saved it as transparent. Nevertheless, I am
      somewhat happy with how this eye turned out. I spent a lot of time trying
      to "perfect" it, especially when it came to the eyelashes, but this is
      ultimately what I came up with.

      <!-- Monster Drawing -->
      Here's my alien drawing! I was heavily inspired by the movie Monsters vs.
      Aliens, although, ironically enough, I recreated a monster instead of an
      alien for this assignment. I'm not even sure if I've watched the movie,
      but when I read the homework I immediately thought about the color scheme
      and general physique of the character B.O.B., with a bubbly, mist-like
      substance closer to the ground. It was hard to try and recreate since I'm
      really not an artist but I think I created some semblance of the image I
      had in mind. Below is the svg version of the same drawing.
