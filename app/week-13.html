    <!-- N/A  -->
    I'm so proud of this project. I spent so many hours figuring out tiny
    details. Working in Photoshop, most of my images were extremely pixelated as
    a result of the small dimensions, but the quality is much better from afar
    in the completed project. Around 90% of my work time was in Photoshop.
    Creating the image maps and coding the new website came the most easily to
    me in this project. However, I really enjoyed the challenge of creating the
    images from scratch to form a cohesive story. I usually avoid focusing on
    the more artistic side of projects, but I took the opportunity to try and
    outdo myself with this assignment. I used quite a few images from online,
    but I also created elements of pages entirely on my own (I'm most proud of
    the hallway when walking towards the lasers, the bank in the title screen,
    and the security guards). I tried my best to minimize my use of outside
    images and create as much as I could from scratch, but I found that many
    elements of my story needed extra help to be communicated properly to
    players.
