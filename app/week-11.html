      This is the infographic I came up with! I had to do a lot of improvising
      this week because I was unable to go to the campus and the iPad version of
      Illustrator was missing some key features for this assignment, including
      the graph feature. I ended up multiplying each value from the survey with
      a constant to create the size of each rectangle, so both graphs are
      proportional and consistent with each other. I changed the color of the
      rectangles to gradients that matched each restaurant's color scheme, and
      added extra rankings on the side. They're not too scientific in the
      information they're conveying -- I chose the "most popular restaurants" by
      using the obvious top three choices in the first question, then breaking
      the tie between second and third place by evaluating the votes on the
      second question. "Worst for your wallet" was even less scientific. I ended
      up looking for restaurants that had higher numbers in the first question
      and lower numbers in the second question. Specifically, five Burger King
      customers took the survey, but not one chose it as the best value. Those
      were the factors I took in with the rankings. I also created the gold,
      silver, bronze, and participant medals, and I'm really happy with how they
      came out. Overall, both my survey questions and the layout of the
      infographic are pretty basic, but I tried to add some flare in the details
      of the design as well as some individuality in how the information itself
      is presented.
