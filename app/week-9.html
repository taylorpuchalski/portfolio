      For my first pattern, I had a completely different color scheme planned. I
      wanted to do something with greens/blues and monochromatic because I found
      the relationship interesting after our lab, but when I opened the Adobe
      Color website, the first color scheme (analogous) shown was too pretty not
      to use. I really liked how different the pinks and purples and blues
      looked, yet how similar in tone they actually were, if that makes any
      sense. I knew I wanted to incorporate the squiggly design I used in this
      pattern because it’s something I’ve been lining my papers in school with
      ever since I was a kid, and it’s something that’s stuck with me all this
      time. I wanted to use it in a similar way as a liner in this piece so I
      made the design square, and then I wanted to incorporate all the colors
      from the scheme so I included smaller squares inside the biggest one. I
      added another squiggly design in the smallest square because I wanted the
      shapes to have some kind of relationship. I then changed the color of each
      squiggly design to the color of the opposing square (a hot pink design for
      the light blue square, and a light blue design for the hot pink square).
      For some reason, the only place I want to picture this design on is a
      quilt. Although the squiggly design might look sloppy on something like a
      quilt since it’s hand-drawn and not exactly proportional, I still believe
      that the pattern contains really strong grandma energy, so to have it
      anywhere else wouldn’t be completely doing it justice.

      <!-- N/A  -->
      For my second pattern, I continued the trend I started a few assignments
      ago and used the color scheme for the old packaging for Softsoap hand
      soap. Since I was a kid, I’ve always found the design with the clownfish
      extremely comforting, and the bright colors were always a part of that
      feeling of comfort. When reevaluating the image to figure out what I
      wanted to do with the colors, I decided that I wanted to reflect its tone
      by creating a more childish pattern. I’m not sure if the Softsoap hand
      soap packaging was actually intended to appeal to children, but the
      imagery always caught my eye as a kid, so I made something that might’ve
      also appealed to me back then. I used the four basic geometric shapes
      available (square, star, circle, and triangle), and then chose to create a
      heart to use up all five colors and create a symmetrical product. I used a
      star to create it and tried to make it as plain-looking as possible to fit
      in with the other default shapes. I included some other details, such as
      the stroke and the very particular arrangement of the shapes. My goal with
      these was to spark some visual interest in the viewer, keeping their eye
      on the pattern for a little longer, while still maintaining its
      simplicity. I could easily see this design in a classroom or other
      environment with primarily children. I think that the color scheme and
      overall pattern is basic, but comforting. Thus, I believe this pattern is
      fitting in the context I was going for.
