      <!-- Intro to First Image  -->
      Here's my first picture! Because I wasn't aware that my camera had no SD
      card for most of the time we were taking pictures, I ended up having to
      rush taking them and only got two compelling pictures. This is the first.
      I created a new adjustment level to try and make "success" more readable
      on the picture and although I didn't accomplish that fully, I definitely
      brightened it and made it a bit easier to decipher. I wanted the red on
      the bottom text to pop so I used light settings to try and enhance the
      color in that section. I also enjoyed playing with adjustments on the
      light by the first words, and eventually decided on a combination that
      conveyed the light's brightness while also directing focus to the words it
      covers at a first glance.
