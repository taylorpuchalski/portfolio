      Here's the first collage I made! Both of my projects had distinct, yet
      connecting themes; this one focused on my accomplishments and ambitions.
      All pictures used in both collages were taken from my phone. There's a
      picture of me and my best friend from the day we graduated and a photo of
      a sign conveying a film shoot happening in the area (to symbolize my
      passions within film and tv production). Blending in with the sky is a
      picture of the word count for an assignment I had last semester, which I
      used the "soft light" blend mode for. Below is a screenshot of this
      project while I was working on it.

      <!-- N/A  -->
      Here's the second collage I made! The theme of this one was a look back on
      the highlights of the last year or so. Pictures in this collage include me
      and my boyfriend, a significant gift box (which is actually green in the
      original image), the envelope from when I sent mail from the first time,
      and a shot from a Megan The Stallion show I attended some months ago. I
      used the "subtract" blend mode for the gift box and "luminosity" on the
      envelope. The background images in both collages were taken in the same
      place, about five minutes apart. I didn't have a particular goal with
      blending, I just tried out different ones and chose what I thought looked
      cool. I didn't expect to change the color of the gift box but I thought it
      fit too well with the warmth of the sky. Below is a screenshot of this
      project while I was working on it.
