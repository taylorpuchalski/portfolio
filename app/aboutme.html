  In my first semester of college, I rejected the idea of pursuing a career in entertainment. Although it
  seemed like the best fit for me and my passion for bringing people together through art, it seemed 
  impossible to thrive in such a competitive industry. Eventually I decided that I wouldn't 
 know if success in entertainment was possible unless I gave it a fair shot. I ended up transferring schools
  and began pursuing a media studies degree. Ever since, I've been ensuring I take every opportunity to
  create meaningful projects. With my art, I intend to start conversations and connect people together through 
  our shared values and experiences. I value the connections I've made through my shared interests more than 
  anything and, as a result, I aim to promote those connections in others. I'm motivated by the idea of
  contributing to projects that captivate and encourage discussion. My first internship with BronxNet Community 
  Television allowed me to learn the basics of video production and creating for TV. Through my second position,
  an internship with the nonprofit JCHHOMES, I was able to work directly with social media, focusing on
  creating short-form video content for promotional posts. In my third internship, marketing at Adam Leitman 
  Bailey, P.C., I've utilized my short-form content creation skills in a corporate setting. Iâ€™m currently in
  search of roles in the production and post-production sector. I would like to spend my time while 
  in college gaining experience in the entertainment industry while creating engaging content.

              I enjoy the creative freedom it offers. While coding it was challenging, it has allowed me to present my work exactly as I want. I've found immense creative fulfillment in assembling the individual elements of this website to craft my dream portfolio. I'm satisfied with its representation of my interests and look forward to updating it with new projects throughout my career.
