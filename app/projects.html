  <br /> As a production assistant intern on CUNY TV's <i>Black America</i>, I conduct research and gather materials
  in pre-production as well as assisting in social media strategy and post-production planning. I also expand on my 
  experience at BronxNet by managing cameras and graphics for other CUNY TV shows.

  As a studio intern at BronxNet TV, I assist producers as needed during filming sessions. 
  I have managed equipment such as teleprompter, audioboard, graphics, and robocams. I have also
  assisted producers on-screen as needed. This internship has been my first exposure to working on
  studio productions, and it's been one of the most valuable learning experiences I've  had in college.

      I'm extremely proud of this project! I initially felt daunted when I was assigned to create a short narrative scene. I was unable to think of a concept for some time. After some brainstorming, I came up with a concept I thought I could pull off! I knew I wanted to create something with a comedic edge, so it felt like a no-brainer to rely on voiceover to convey some kind of internal monologue. When I decided to set the film at the entrance of my school, I felt the narrative pieces begin to come together. Most of the shots and VO lines were filmed in one take, which I believe adds to the authenticity of the story --  A slightly messy portrayal of a relatable college experience just feels right in retrospect. However, looking back, there are some glaring areas I can improve. Specifically, I know I can refine the VO for a more seamless sound among the other layers, as well as adjust the visuals for more concision. I plan to revise this project, putting more time into the editing, and re-publishing it in the coming months.

     In my time as a Marketing and Communications intern with Adam Leitman Bailey, P.C., I helped manage a social media campaign in promotion of the firm's values. Among my responsibilities, I co-managed social media content planning and creation, which often took the form of summaries of the firm's case studies. I learned the fundamentals of AI voiceover and utilized my existing skills in Adobe Premiere Pro and B-roll pulling throughout the creation of this project.

     ROB THE BANK is one of my all-time favorite projects. At first, I was intimidated about building a 
      website from scratch to host this game. However, similarly to 
      my experience hosting my own portfolio, I appreciated the freedom that came 
      with creating a story from scratch. Most illustrations used were created by me, which added
      an extra layer of personality to the game. In the past, I used to avoid projects that challenged
      me artistically. This project was one of the first times I tried to outdo my own expectations for 
      my art. I'm most proud of the hallway when walking towards the lasers, the bank in the title screen,
    and the security guards.
      
      <br />
      <br />
       
      Looking back, there are a number of things I would've done differently in order to ensure a smoother 
      and more visually appealing product. Namely, most of my image maps came out blurry due to excessive
      format conversions, and I wish I hadn't relied on publicly-sourced visual elements as much as I had.
      I'm excited by the new perspective I've gained since I created ROB THE BANK because it proves 
      I'm constantly evolving as an artist. I'm proud of the story I told with ROB THE BANK and I look 
      forward to using the knowledge I've gained from it to create bigger, better stories in the future.

<h2>Exploring Thomas Hunter Hall - A Short Film</h2>

      With this project, I set out to capture the essence of Thomas Hunter Hall, a building in the Hunter 
  College campus. I found the areas featured by mistake after getting lost during my first week at Hunter.
  I remembered the building when I was given the assignment of defining a place through film. 
  The staircases and hallways were filled with artwork that I knew would make a great exploration. I wanted to highlight the pottery hallway in particular – many student projects are taken off display once they’re graded, so I set out to create a new life for the pottery. I filmed from the 
  perspective of a lost student, with each floor more confusing than the last. I welcomed the unstable
  movements and dim moments that I experienced walking and up the stairs weeks before.
I appreciated the opportunity to closely examine the art I would've otherwise overlooked. Hunter's students
  have an incredible amount of talent to display and I'm glad I got to encapsulate it in a format I can 
keep with me after I graduate. I would never have seen Thomas Hunter Hall had I not gotten lost that day, and
  I hope this film can encourage people to explore parts of their life they wouldn't normally think twice about.

<p style="text-align:right; margin-top: -35px;padding-left: 50%;padding-right:20px">
This project showcases an in-depth interview I conducted with a classmate of mine, Derick. My goal was to 
  create a comprehensive image of Derick through his story retelling. My questions focused on his experience in 
  college as a film major with an interest in the Japanese language. They also explored some of his daily 
  struggles – as a student who also works part time and lives alone, Derick had a unique story to tell
  about chasing his dreams in New York City. 
<br />
<br />
Overall, I'm proud of how this interview turned out. It was one of my first times editing strictly sound, and 
  I believe this project can be elevated by the addition of music or relevant sound effects. I also see room 
  for improvement by either making it longer to expand on its themes, or making it more concise in its subject
  matter for more clarity.

<p style="text-align:left;margin-top: -5px;padding-right: 50%;padding-left:20px">
    This is one of the bigger projects I’ve taken on recently. For the first time, I oversaw the production of this video from conception to publishing. I produced this project for JCHHOMES, a nonprofit organization based in Queens. They work with the goal of providing services to populations at risk of homelessness. Throughout my time interning at JCHHOMES, I collaborated with my coworkers on projects that would allow us to obtain school supplies for students at a Queens elementary school. Our goal was to collect in-kind donations, as well as raise at least $1000 through social media fundraising. I created this video, an interview with a parent coordinator at the elementary school, in order to raise awareness about the struggles of at-risk children and the initiatives JCHHOMES has taken to make a difference. I prepared a number of interview questions for the parent coordinator with the aim of engaging audiences interested in social issues and making a difference, and encouraging them to explore giving back through JCHHOMES.

<h2>BLINK - Animated Eye Gif</h2>

 <p style="text-align:right;margin-top:30px;padding-left:45%;padding-right:20px">
This gif is the project that helped me discover my love for animation. I wanted to illustrate an eye that conveys an emotion, so I decided to create an eye roll. I had a lot of fun making this! I plan to go back in and add more frames in order to make the gif play more smoothly, but I’m still proud of how it turned out originally. I want to take courses in the future that will teach me the fundamentals of 2D animation and provide me with the skills to create bigger and better versions of this gif. I’m not sure if I will continue to pursue a career in animation after college, but this project only proved that I’m on the right path as a media studies major — I feel most fulfilled when I’m part of projects that push me creatively and teach me how to produce content.

<h2>My Thoughts on I, Tonya - A Video Essay</h2>

This is my first project to be aired on television! "My Thoughts on I, Tonya" is a short video essay I created in 2021, during my time at BronxNet. It served as a standalone segment in our third episode of Open 2.0. Looking back, I'm proud that I pushed past the difficulties that came with self-producing, as well as creating a TV segment in a video essay format. I also believe that there was substantial room for improvement on this project -- I would produce the video very differently now considering the tips and tricks I've learned over the past few years. However, it remains a project I'm happy to have taken on, created during an experience I still treasure.
