      <!-- Intro to Second Image  -->
      This is the picture I'm more confident in. I was really intrigued by the
      fact that the art within the image was already surrounded and highlighted
      by the light in the location, so I decided to emphasize that relationship
      when I was editing. I tried to brighten the colors of the stickers as much
      as possible, then minimized the light fixture's brightness just a little
      so that it didn't distract from the other colors. My goal was to direct
      eyes to the stickers, and I think I accomplished that goal.
