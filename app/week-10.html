      <!-- eye gif  -->
      Out of all the projects I've made in this course so far, this one was my
      favorite and the one I'm most proud of. There are a few errors in the
      drawings but I had a lot of fun creating the different frames. I
      especially like the fact that they eye closes slightly when the pupil is
      low. I also enjoy the little speck of light I made to move around the eye
      as it rolled. It's not extremely accurate but I think it's a charming
      detail. I wish I'd been able to maintain a transparent background for the
      gif but unfortunately, I had some issues transferring the layers from
      Illustrator to Photoshop and it looked like it was the only option if I
      wanted to use the same files I'd already made.

      <!-- puppet warp gif  -->
      I spent a lot of much time adjusting this gif and it still doesn't feel
      exactly right. My goal was to make us raise our hands much more than is
      seen here, but I wasn't having any luck with moving our arms
      significantly. We're also dancing a little, which wasn't my intention. I
      tried to make the frames match each other as much as possible outside of
      our arm movement but I was having trouble with the points -- I would try
      to adjust one body part back to normal and our arms or hands would become
      distorted. I'm satisfied with the final results, although there are some
      glaring factors that I wish were different (such as our hands getting longer
      with each frame). All the adjustments I'd made also created some funny
      moments, where we'd do weird movements or just stand unnaturally.
