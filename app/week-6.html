      Here's the first concrete poem I made! I wanted the street light to show
      its illumination at full opacity, and to put an effect on the text to show
      that it's being affected by the light. I didn't have a specific goal with
      how it would turn out so I tried different designs until I settled on this
      one. I really like the contrast between the white and black text. The text
      splicing was difficult to figure out and I couldn't change the font on
      either of my pieces but I think the message is clear. I wanted the art to
      match how dramatic the poem was, and to capture some symbolism in that
      severing ties with someone can make you remember that there's a whole
      world beyond what you can currently see. Below are two screenshots that I
      took in the process.

      Here's my second concrete poem! It's the one I spent more time on and,
      honestly, the one I'm more proud of. I spent half an hour trying to figure
      out how to rotate it back in Glitch. It's pretty difficult to navigate some
      parts of our assignments because there isn't much information online about
      how to actually operate Glitch, including tutorials. Nevertheless, I like
      the finished product. My in-class assignment was inspired by the labels on
      Softsoap bottles (the soap with the fish on it), and my homework was
      inspired by my in-class assignment. I love the colors on the background
      image and the dynamic inspired the colors I used on the fish. I also found
      the picture of the seashell separately and thought they all worked too
      well together not to use it. In my eyes, the image is serene but the
      colors are slightly unsettling. It ties into the theme of stress in the
      poem. Below are two screenshots that I took in the process.
