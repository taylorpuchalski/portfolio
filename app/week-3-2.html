      <!-- N/A  -->
      Here are the edited and unedited versions, respectively, of each photo
      that I adjusted the exposure of and straightened. Honestly, I couldn't
      find out how to "correctly" straighten the images using my iPad. I ended
      up using the rotate feature instead and trying my best to align the
      subjects with the grid that automatically appears when rotating. I'm not
      sure how to remove the glare that came out on the first photo, so I left
      it alone, but I am looking forward to learning what to do about an issue
      like that. Also, the "trash only" sign on the second photo is blurrier than I
      would've liked it to be, but I tried my best to adjust the exposure
      settings to make it as clear as possible.
